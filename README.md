Note:
1. Since proc is a keyword, we use proce as the label for a procedure value
2. The statement for calling Sum is [sum ident(X) ident(Y) ident(Z)], where X and Y are the 2 arguments whose sum needs to be stored in the argument Z.
3. The statement for calling Product looks like [product ident(X) ident(Y) ident(Z)].
4. We are only handling integers for Sum and Product
