Some points to note:

1. Since proc is a keyword, we use proce as the label for a procedure value.
2. The statement for calling Sum is [sum ident(X) ident(Y) ident(Z)], where X and Y are the 2 arguments whose sum needs to be stored in the argument Z.
3. The statement for calling Product looks like [product ident(X) ident(Y) ident(Z)].
4. We are only handling integers for Sum and Product.
5. We have solve all the questions.

To run the code:
1. In the file Main.oz, assign AST to the source code in the Abstract Syntax Tree format.
